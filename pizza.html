        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>

        <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes pizza crust yeast.</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>

        <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>1⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>

        <li>⅓ cup oil</li>

        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>This delicious pizza can be made relatively easy by following the steps below.
        Make sure to have all of your ingredients ready!
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
        </li>
